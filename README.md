# MyReads Project

Welcome! 

My name is Jori and this is my first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. 
For this project, I've created a small application through which you can add books you like to read. Each book can be categorized as either `currently reading`, `want to read`, or `read`.

To add a book, use the `Add a book` button in the bottom right of the page.

## Setup

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
